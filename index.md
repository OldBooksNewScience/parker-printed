Viewing annotations in their manuscript context allows us to reconstruct how early-modern readers read medieval texts. This online catalogue will allow users to search and browse descriptions of printed books from the Parker collection, with marginal annotations by Matthew Parker and his circle. It will be built to standards shared across the digital humanities scholarly community. From data model to metadata schema, from content management system to interface, the catalogue will be designed for extensibility, modularity, interoperability, and preservation.
